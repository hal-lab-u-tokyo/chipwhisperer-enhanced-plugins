    "## Tutorial: Second-Order CPA Attack\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to perform a second-order Correlation Power Analysis (SO-CPA) attack using the accelerated CPA implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use the ASCAD dataset as the target for the SO-CPA attack. The workflow consists of the following steps:\n",
    "1. **Download the ASCAD dataset.**\n",
    "2. **Convert the dataset to ChipWhisperer Project format.**\n",
    "3. **Setup a SO-CPA attack and execute it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preliminary knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "Various types of high-order CPA attacks have been proposed in the literature. Our implementation follows the product combining method, which is known to be the most efficient for second-order attacks. For more details, refer to the following paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prouff, Emmanuel, Matthieu Rivain, and Régis Bevan. \"Statistical analysis of second order differential power analysis.\" *IEEE Transactions on Computers* 58.6 (2009): 799-811.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that $N$ traces are available for the attack. When focusing on two sample points $t_1$ and $t_2$, we have two vectors of power traces $\\mathbf{W}(t_1)$ and $\\mathbf{W}(t_2)$, each of size $N$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to combine these vectors is through element-wise multiplication:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{C}(t_1, t_2) = \\mathbf{W}(t_1) \\odot \\mathbf{W}(t_2)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more efficient combination, each element of the vector is subtracted by the mean of the vector:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{C}(t_1, t_2) = (\\mathbf{W}(t_1) - \\bar{\\mathbf{W}}(t_1)) \\odot (\\mathbf{W}(t_2) - \\bar{\\mathbf{W}}(t_2))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is known as the normalized product combining method. Our SO-CPA library implements the normalized product combining approach to enhance the efficiency of second-order attacks.\n",
    "However, if we do not limit the number of combined sample points, the number of produced vectors — and consequently, the number of correlation computations — grows quadratically with the number of sample points. For instance, if we have $T$ sample points, we will need to compute $T(T-1)/2$ correlations. To address this, a window size is introduced, as described in the following paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bottinelli, Paul, and Joppe W. Bos. \"Computational aspects of correlation power analysis.\" *Journal of Cryptographic Engineering* 7 (2017): 167-181.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is based on the observation that meaningful combined points are often close to each other. However, selecting a window size that is too small may result in the loss of significant correlations. Therefore, the window size should be chosen carefully, taking into account the target device and the specific attack scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "To convert the ASCAD dataset to ChipWhisperer project format, you need to get the following Python packages installed:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install numpy h5py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Download and Prepare the ASCAD Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to download the ASCAD dataset, which contains power traces for side-channel analysis. You can obtain it from the [ASCAD repository](https://github.com/ANSSI-FR/ASCAD).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the fixed key version of the ATMEGA power traces: `ASCAD/ATMEGA_AES_v1/ATM_AES_v1_fixed_key`. Follow the instructions in the repository to download the dataset. Ensure that the file `ATMega8515_raw_traces.h5` is located in the unzipped directory `ASCAD_data/ASCAD_databases`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Overview\n",
    "- The raw dataset contains **60,000 traces**, each with **100,000 samples**.\n",
    "- According to the dataset description, **700 samples** in the range `(45400, 46100)` are selected as the attack target. This range corresponds to the processing of the **2nd key byte** of AES encryption (zero-based index). Other key bytes cannot be recovered.\n",
    "- Out of the 60,000 traces:\n",
    "\t- **50,000 traces** are used for profiling.\n",
    "\t- The remaining **10,000 traces** are used for the attack.\n",
    "Therefore, we will use only the last 10,000 traces for the attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "Run the following code block to select the `ATMega8515_raw_traces.h5` file. A file chooser will be displayed. Once you select a valid file, a checkmark will confirm the selection.\n"
